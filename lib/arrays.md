# What are some examples of information that would be Arrays as opposed to some other data type?

Replace me with your response...

# What is one way, using Ruby, to retrieve the 6th element in an Array? How about the 8th element? What happens if you try to retrieve the value of the _9999th_ element (or some element that doesn't exist in the array)?

Replace me with your response...

# The previous question asks about finding, for example, the 6th element in an Array. Is it possible to find the **-6th** (Notice the negative symbol!) element in an Array? What does that even mean?

Replace me with your response...

# How would you perform an operation on every element inside an Array?

Replace me with your response...

# How do you add elements to an Array?

Replace me with your response...

# Given the Array `["Laura", "Fiona", "Tori"]`, how would you replace `"Fiona"` with `"Florence"` so that you end up with `["Laura", "Florence", "Tori"]`?

Replace me with your response...

# What do the methods `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` do?

Replace me with your response...

# How do you determine how many elements are in an Array?

Replace me with your response...

# How would you reverse the order of elements in an Array?

Replace me with your response...

# How would you convert a String `"Sumeet Jain"` into an Array `["Sumeet", "Jain"]`? How about to `["S", "u", "m", "e", "e", "t", " ", "J", "a", "i", "n"]`? How would you convert the Array back into a String?
